# SVD convolutions

This is an implementation of an algorithm for appoximate convolutions in linear time, lol.


# Results

## Test run results

We tested on randomly genrated grayscale images.
We used these functions:

-   `numpy.convolve2d`

-   `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`

-   Our own implementation of SVD concvolutions

## Images

Here is the image generated by a 5x5 circular filter with classic convolutions:
